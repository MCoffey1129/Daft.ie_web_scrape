# Overview - Python code used to extract property price information from the Daft.ie website
################################################################################################################


# Please note there is a package called daftlistings which was created by Anthony Bloomer and 6 other contributors
# if you want to check that out

# Before web scraping there are some key questions you first want to answer:

# Qs 1) What exactly are you looking for, is this clearly defined?
# Ans 1) We want to pull the following information from properties which are for sale on the Daft.ie website:
#        Property price, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and type of property
#        (we will also include any land that is for sale which can be easily deleted at a later time)


# Qs 2)  Where exactly would we get this information on the Daft.ie website?
# Ans 2) We would go to the following URL - https://www.daft.ie/property-for-sale/ireland for the first 20 adverts
#        https://www.daft.ie/property-for-sale/ireland?from=20&pageSize=20 for adverts 20 - 40
#        https://www.daft.ie/property-for-sale/ireland?pageSize=20&from=40 for adverts 40 - 60
#        https://www.daft.ie/property-for-sale/ireland?pageSize=20&from=60 for adverts 60 - 80 etc.
#        as you can see we will be able to create a loop to bring in all these properties.

# Qs 3)  What does the html code look like?
# Ans 3) Go to the main page https://www.daft.ie/property-for-sale/ireland, right click on the page and select "inspect"
#        The html code will show up on your screen.

# Qs 4)  Is there any potential inconsistencies in the html code which will make it difficult to scrape property info?
# Ans 4) Most properties on "Daft.ie" are in the "normal" format whereby each block of code contains one property for
#        sale with the price, location, bedrooms etc. all in the same section of code.

#        There are however "special" ads, these are ads that usually have multiple properties for sale at one location,
#        the issue for us is that the html code for these properties is not consistent with code for 'normal' properties
#        We will pull these two sets of properties out separately and combine them at the end.

################################################################################################################
# Section 1 - We will firstly do a simple web scrape of the first 20 ads on Daft.ie to see if there is
#             any potential issues with the code

# Pull the html code into a variable called req

# Create a beautiful soup object soup which will be used to parse the html code
soup = bs(req_str, 'html.parser')
print(type(soup))

# From looking at the html code the location information for the first property is in the following block of html
# <p data-testid="address" class="TitleBlock__Address-sc-1avkvav-7 knPImU">30 Cedarmount Road, Mount Merrion,
# Co. Dublin</p>
# We want to search our html for each paragraph ('p') which contains class = "TitleBlock...."
# We repeat for bringing in the bed, bath and area , building type and price.

loc_bs = soup.findAll('p', {'class': 'TitleBlock__Address-sc-1avkvav-7 knPImU'})
bed_bath_area_bs = soup.findAll('div', {'class': 'TitleBlock__CardInfo-sc-1avkvav-9 QvaxK'})
btype_bs = soup.findAll('p', {'class': 'TitleBlock__CardInfoItem-sc-1avkvav-8 bcaKbv'})
price_span_bs = soup.findAll('span', {'class': 'TitleBlock__StyledSpan-sc-1avkvav-4 gDBFnc'})

len(loc_bs)  # not all of the ads are brought into Python at the time of running this only 19 properties are included

# Let us put the first 17 values into a list and then a dataframe to see if there are any issues
prop_info = []
for i in range(17):
    prop_info_i = [loc_bs[i].text, bed_bath_area_bs[i].text, btype_bs[i].text, price_span_bs[i].text]
    prop_info.append(prop_info_i)

prop_info_df = pd.DataFrame(prop_info)
print(prop_info_df)

# Findings:
# The code correctly brings in the location (column 1), bed, bath and area (column 2), property type (column 3)
# and price (column 4). There are a number of issues however, the html code is written differently
# for the "special" ads or ads which contain multiple properties. At present we are not taking in any information on
# these properties except for the Price which seems to be taken in as a statement rather than an actual price.
# You should be able to see this in your code as the price and location are not matched.
# We need to take note of this when we do our web scrape!!
